= tabelle

== Install

1.Either copy the gem into your rails plugin folder or the usual

  config.gem 'tabelle'
  
1.I haven't solved a slight technical issue with inheritance, so you'll have to append the tabelle views folder to your default view folder directly in the ApplicationController:

  append_view_path(Tabelle.views_path)
  


Description goes here.

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
