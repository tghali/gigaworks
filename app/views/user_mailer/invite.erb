Dear <%= @invite.recipient.full_name %>,
Please find your invite link for the Nord Anglia Mawhiba Advanced Supplementary curriculum, assessment and training online glossaries. These glossaries are the only Mawhiba approved glossaries for use in this project.

<%= sign_up_url(:invite_token => @invite.token) %>

Once registered you will be been given editorial access. This means that you can add items to the glossary as you work on translation and editing. 

All new additions will go for approval by Mawhiba. This will ensure that the glossary is up to date and continually improved and approved.

We are currently working on terms where a conflict exists in the glossaries. As soon as these conflicting terms are live and approved, we will send an update email.

Please contact Alex Tarran directly on alex.tarran@gmail.com if you have any queries.

Nord Anglia (Education) Ltd.
