          %p.headding_text At its best e-learning technology can improve education outcomes, increase engagement with learners, add flexibility (and fun), and improve organisational performance, while delivering substantial cost and time savings. 
          %p{:style=>"margin-top:10px;"} But it&#39;s easy to get wrong. A confusing interactive environment with complicated tools or content which hasn&#39;t been designed to be used interactively can drive learners offline, never to return.
          %p{:style=>"margin-bottom:18px;"} We work closely with our clients on all our e&#45;learning projects to ensure the technical solution works hand in hand with the content to create an engaging, refreshing and highly effective learning space.

          %p{:style=>"margin-bottom:18px;"} We&#39;ll draw on our experience to cut through the confusion and solve the technical challenges, while helping you make even the most difficult of subjects come alive in the e&#45;learning environment.

          %p{:style=>"margin-top:10px;"} The key to all learning is attention, and games and quizzes are a very useful way of keeping learners engaged and active. Used through a learning course or module, they make e&#45;learning more interactive and they&#39;re also useful for evaluating the progress of the learner. In addition, they can provide insights into the effectiveness of your course content. 
          %p{:style=>"margin-bottom:18px;"} At Gigavine we build all kinds of quizzes and games &#45; simple or complex&#45;using various tools such as flash, HTML and Articulate, which can not only deliver a powerful experience for the learning but collect data at the same time.

        - else	 
          %p{:style=>"margin-top:10px;"} A learning management system (LMS) or virtual learning environment (VLE) is the software system that puts e&#45;learning in place. It handles the learners&#39; and the tutors&#39; interactions with the system, and it enables you to publish materials, communicate with students, etc. It is the heart of your e&#45;learning environment, and the choice of LMS you make has far&#45;reaching consequences. 
          %p{:style=>"margin-bottom:18px;"} There are many of those packages available, open source and commercial, and picking the best one for your purposes is a difficult decision. We can help you make that decision. Alternatively we can build you a bespoke system to meet your exact needs.

          %p{:style=>"margin-top:10px;"} Sometimes off the shelf learning management systems just won&#39;t fit the kind of e&#45;learning project you&#39;re planning. Trying to force things to fit a rigid and inappropriate system can save money in the short term but lead to serious problems later on. 
          %p{:style=>"margin-bottom:18px;"} If nothing fits we can design, develop and build a bespoke LMS to your precise requirements, integrating with your website and your payment gateways and any other third party systems as necessary, and we&#39;ll include your input and sign&#45;off every step of the way.
